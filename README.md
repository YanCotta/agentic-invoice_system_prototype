# 📊 Brim Invoice Processing System

## 🎯 Overview
An intelligent invoice processing system leveraging LangChain's multi-agent workflow to automate extraction, validation, and purchase order (PO) matching. Built for the "Technical Challenge: Intelligent Invoice Processing with LangChain Multi-Agent Workflow" to reduce manual processing time by 75% and minimize errors.

## 📋 Key Features
- Processes PDFs from:
  - `data/raw/invoices/` (35 invoices)
  - `data/raw/test_samples/` (3 PDFs)
- Integrates multiple agents for extraction, validation, matching, human review, and fallback procedures
- Implements RAG-based error handling and performance monitoring
- Utilizes async processing with robust error handling, structured logging, and retries

### Day 2: Invoice Extraction Agent
#### 🔧 Implementation Details
- **InvoiceExtractionAgent** (`agents/extractor_agent.py`):
  - Utilizes LangChain 0.2.16 with Mistral 7B (Ollama)
  - Extracts structured data from PDFs

#### 🛠️ Components
1. **PDF Parsing & OCR**
   - `data_processing/document_parser.py` (pdfplumber)
   - `data_processing/ocr_helper.py` (pytesseract)

2. **Data Models**
   - `InvoiceData` model built with Pydantic v2
   - Supports required and optional fields with Decimal precision

3. **Processing Features**
   - Confidence scoring
   - JSON logging
   - Error handling with fallback mechanisms

#### 📊 Sample Output
```json
{
  "vendor_name": "ABC Corp Ltd.",
  "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
  "invoice_date": "2024-02-18",
  "total_amount": "7595.00",
  "confidence": 0.955
}
```

#### Invoice Validation & Extraction Refinement
- **InvoiceValidationAgent** (`agents/validator_agent.py`):
  - Validates extracted data for missing fields and format inconsistencies
  - Adds anomaly detection for duplicates and outliers
  - Orchestrates extraction and validation workflows

**Improvements:**
- Enhanced error handling using try-except blocks
- Processed PDFs from multiple subdirectories
- Introduced Pydantic v2 validation models

#### 📊 Sample Output
```json
{
  "extracted_data": { ... },
  "validation_result": { "status": "valid", "errors": {} }
}
```

#### PO Matching & Multi-Agent Coordination
- **PurchaseOrderMatchingAgent**:
  - Implements fuzzy matching for purchase order validation
  - Integrates full pipeline orchestration
  - Resolves CSV column mismatches
  - Provides comprehensive logging

#### 📊 Sample Output
```json
{
  "extracted_data": { ... },
  "validation_result": { "status": "valid", "errors": {} },
  "matching_result": { "status": "unmatched", "po_number": null, "match_confidence": 0.0 }
}
```

#### Error Handling, Edge Cases & Human-in-the-Loop
- Added async processing with retry mechanisms
- **Human Review API** implemented in `api/review_api.py` using FastAPI to allow manual corrections via a “veteran reviewer” prompt
- Optimized logging configuration and enhanced async compatibility

**Improvements:**
- Fixed asyncio dependencies
- Adjusted extraction prompts
- Enhanced error handling

#### 📊 Sample Output
```json
{
  "extracted_data": {
    "vendor_name": "ABC Corp Ltd.",
    "invoice_number": "INV-2024-001",
    "invoice_date": "2024-02-18",
    "total_amount": "7595.00",
    "confidence": 0.955,
    "po_number": null,
    "tax_amount": null,
    "currency": null
  },
  "validation_result": {
    "status": "valid",
    "errors": {} 
  },
  "matching_result": {
    "status": "unmatched",
    "po_number": null,
    "match_confidence": 0.0
  },
  "review_result": {
    "status": "approved",
    "invoice_data": { ... }
  }
}
```

Additional Enhancements:
- Updated LLM prompt in `agents/extractor_agent.py` to enforce JSON-only output, improving parsing reliability
- Integrated FAISS-based RAG module in `data_processing/rag_helper.py` to store error invoices and classify new ones, reducing the need for human intervention
- Maintained verbose logging for effective debugging and performance tracking

---

### Day 3: Advanced Error Handling, RAG Integration, and Extraction Refinement

#### 🎯 Goals
- Enhance error handling using RAG to preemptively address edge cases
- Refine the extraction agent for consistent and reliable output
- Introduce performance monitoring to track pipeline efficiency

#### 🔨 Activities
- **Terminal Analysis:**
  - Ran `python workflows/orchestrator.py` and observed AgentExecutor processing
  - Noted narrative text in LLM JSON-like output causing parsing failures
  - Identified inconsistent formatting in `total_amount` (e.g., "1793.7" vs. "1793.70")

- **Extraction Agent Refinement:**
  - Updated prompt in `agents/extractor_agent.py` to enforce strict JSON-only response
  - Added post-processing with regex to clean any extraneous narrative text

- **Enhanced Error Handling with RAG:**
  - Integrated FAISS-based RAG in `data_processing/rag_helper.py` to classify invoices against known error cases
  - Updated extraction logic to log warnings if an invoice is similar to known error-prone cases

- **Fallback Mechanism:**
  - Added `agents/fallback_agent.py` implementing regex-based extraction as a backup

- **Monitoring:**
  - Developed `config/monitoring.py` to log execution times and integrate performance tracking in `workflows/orchestrator.py`
- **Data Persistence:**
  - Saved processed results in `data/processed/structured_invoices.json` for further analysis

#### 🛠️ Challenges and Solutions
- **LLM Narrative Output:**
  - Challenge: LLM output wrapping JSON in narrative text
  - Solution: Enforce JSON-only output and apply regex cleaning, with fallback extraction if necessary

- **Inconsistent Formatting:**
  - Challenge: Variations in `total_amount` formatting
  - Solution: Standardize post-processing to ensure two decimal places

#### 📊 Expected Sample Output
```json
{
  "vendor_name": "Solis Inc",
  "invoice_number": "IN_3515484",
  "invoice_date": "2025-01-30",
  "total_amount": "1793.70",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

#### 📝 Notes for CEO
- **Progress:** Ahead of schedule; already integrating advanced features (monitoring and full pipeline orchestration) on Day 3
- **Challenges:** Addressed LLM output consistency with prompt refinement and regex cleaning
- **Next Steps:** Finalize parsing reliability and commence frontend development on Day 4
